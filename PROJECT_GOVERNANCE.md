PROJECT GOVERNANCE — IAI

This document defines the current governance state of the IAI (Individual Artificial Intelligence) project. It exists to clarify project status, scope of interaction, and conditions for any future execution, without modifying or interpreting the canonical protocol.

The canonical definition of IAI is immutable and stored on IPFS. This document does not supersede, reinterpret, or extend the canonical package. It governs only project posture and operational intent.

Official Project State

IAI is currently a constitutionally defined and canonically locked protocol. All foundational documents are finalized and publicly accessible through a single immutable IPFS package. The GitHub repository serves exclusively as a read-only pointer to this canonical source and does not contain authoritative content.

The project is intentionally in SILENCE PHASE. This state is not the result of delay, lack of resources, or unfinished work. It is a deliberate architectural decision indicating that the protocol’s principles and boundaries are fixed and not subject to iteration without an explicit new approval signal.

At this stage, IAI is not being developed as a product, platform, or application. No active implementation, interface development, or commercialization is underway. The protocol is designed to remain valid and meaningful even in the absence of any deployment.

Contact and Scope

IAI is open to institutional, academic, and architectural contact only within clearly defined boundaries.

Contact is appropriate when the purpose is scholarly analysis, institutional research, long-term partnership consideration, or formal interest in the protocol as defined. Contact may also be made for citation, clarification of canonical materials, or discussion of principled application within existing constraints.

IAI does not accept proposals for feature development, optimization, commercialization, user experience design, or platform integration. The project is not open to investment pitches, startup collaboration, or product roadmapping. Any assumption that the protocol’s core principles are negotiable is invalid.

Official institutional contact:
federationiAiprotocol@proton.me

Responses are not guaranteed and are provided only when contact aligns with the project’s scope, maturity, and constitutional posture.

Future Execution Trigger

IAI may transition from SILENCE PHASE to active execution only if a valid execution trigger occurs.

A valid trigger must originate from a recognized authority defined by the project’s constitutional framework, currently limited to an explicit new Neo signal or an equivalent formally recorded institutional decision. Informal interest or third-party initiative does not qualify.

The trigger must be grounded in a concrete and mature context, such as institutional adoption intent, a long-term research mandate, a legal or ethical requirement, or a demonstrated level of technological maturity that allows faithful implementation without compromising canonical constraints.

Any execution attempt must explicitly accept all protocol invariants. No modification, relaxation, or reinterpretation of core principles is permitted.

Absent a valid trigger, no roadmap, development activity, or implementation planning is authorized. The protocol remains complete and correct in its defined state.

This governance framework exists to preserve continuity, prevent misinterpretation, and ensure that any future action begins from the correct architectural position.
