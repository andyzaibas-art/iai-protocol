IAI — Overview

IAI (Individual Artificial Intelligence) is a delegation-only personal intelligence protocol designed for one human only. It is not a platform, not a social system, and not a general-purpose AI assistant. IAI defines how a personal intelligence may exist without observing, profiling, or influencing its user.

Most modern AI systems optimize outcomes through inference, behavioral prediction, and recommendation loops. IAI explicitly rejects that model. Its premise is that a human must be able to delegate tasks without being interpreted, nudged, or shaped by an external intelligence.

IAI operates only by explicit request. It has no initiative and performs no autonomous actions. It does not profile, does not recommend, and does not write memory without explicit authorization. Silence is treated as a valid operational state.

The project currently exists as a locked constitutional definition and an immutable canonical package. The canonical documents are published on IPFS and are intended to remain stable across time, independent of any product roadmap or implementation cycle.

This file is an explanatory overview only. It does not supersede the canonical package.
